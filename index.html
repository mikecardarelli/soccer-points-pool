  <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>Want to start your own pool? Here are the full rules:</p>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Teams: Each entrant drafts a set of soccer teams and follows them for the whole season.</li>
            <li>Scoring: The standings are determined by adding up the point totals of everyone's teams (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). First place goes to whoever has the most combined points at the end of the season.</li>
            <li>Special pandemic-era rules addendum: If one or more leagues abandon their seasons like Ligue 1 did in 2020, the final standings will be based on the games actually completed during the season (in other words, don't prorate the points based on games played).</li>
            <li>Special corruption-related rules addendum: If any team has points docked by a sport governing body like Juventus did in 2023, the final standings will reflect that point deduction.</li>
        </ul>

  <h3>Tier 1</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>13 entrants draft 6 teams from top 4 leagues in Europe (English PL, Spanish La Liga, Italian Serie A, German Bundesliga).</li>
        </ul>
    
  <h3>Tier 2</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>18 entrants draft 8 teams from the top 8 leagues in Europe (English PL, Spanish La Liga, Italian Serie A, German Bundesliga, French Ligue 1, Dutch Eredivisie, Portuguese Primeira Liga, Turkish Süper Lig).</li>
        </ul>
    
  <h3>Promotion + Relegation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The bottom 6 entrants from the tier 1 pool at the end of the season will be relegated to the tier 2 pool for next season.</li>
            <li>The top 6 entrants from the tier 2 pool at the end of the season will be promoted to the tier 1 pool for next season.</li>
        </ul>

  <h3>The Draft</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a snake draft with the order randomly determined.</li>
            <li>Drafts take place in google sheets, using Slack/email to communicate who is up next.</li>
            <li>In tier 1 you must pick a team from each of the 4 leagues with your first 4 selections. In rounds 5 and 6 you can take teams from any league.</li>
            <li>In tier 2 you can only take 1 team from each of the 8 leagues.</li>
            <li>Double picks - After round 4 in both tiers, each entrant will draft 2 teams in a row to speed up the later rounds of the draft.</li>
        </ul>

  <h3>Tie-Breakers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If there's a tie in the final standings, the first place tie-breaker goes to the entrant with the highest single-team total, and the last place tie-breaker goes to the entrant with the lowest single-team total.</li>
            <li>Similarly, entrants vying for promotion break a tie with the highest single-team total getting promoted, and entrants trying to avoid relegation break a tie with the lowest single-team total getting relegated.</li>
        </ul>
